# Non-specific omissions
- Most "replacement" software is omitted due to causing breakage or interfering
with user freedom.

Examples include most rust replacements for common utilities, such as sudo-rs
or ntpd-rs. 

There may be exceptions for software which does not interfere with existing
user software preferences.

For example, `apparmor` is whitelisted from this due to being the only usable
MAC system on NixOS.

Future reference for potentially useful software which is still omitted under
this rule may be added to [ADDITIONAL-RESOURCES.md](ADDITIONAL-RESOURCES.md)

# Specific omissions
Features in sources of research for `nix-mineral` which have been intentionally omitted due to irrelevancy or logistical issues.

sysctl omitted from K4YT3X config that are out of scope of nix-mineral and
hardening  but may be useful anyways to some, see their repo for details:
