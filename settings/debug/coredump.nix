      Disable core dumps everywhere. Core dumps contain a programs memory,
      usually after a crash, which could include sensitive information
      including encryption keys being written to the disk without any
      protection.

      This disables core dumps using a combination of sysctl, PAM, and
      systemd. These are grouped together, because the disablement of
      any individual one of these might otherwise make available a bypass.

      You might need core dumps when debugging crashing programs.
