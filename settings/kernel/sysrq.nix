        Control the magic SysRq key functionality of the Linux kernel.
        It is a 'magical' key combo you can hit which the kernel will respond to regardless of whatever else it is doing,
        unless it is completely locked up.

        `none` - Keep the default configuration of your kernel.
        `off` - Disables sysrq completely.
        `sak` - Enable SAK (Secure Attention Key).

        SAK prevents keylogging, if used correctly.
