        Number of IPv6 Router Solicitations to send until assuming no routers
        are present. Setting to 0 limits outgoing traffic on the network,
        and reduces the frequecy of IPv6 router advertisements received.

        There is no point to setting this number above 0 if all router
        advertisements are not accepted.

        See RFC4681 for details.

        Set this to `false` to disable this option entirely.
