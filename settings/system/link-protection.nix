      Protect hardlinks and softlinks to prevent TOCTOU attacks.

      Prevent users from hardlinking to files they can't read/write to.

      Allows symlinks to be followed only outside world writable directories,
      when the owner and follower match, or when the directory and symlink
      owner match.
