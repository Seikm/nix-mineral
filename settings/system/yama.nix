        Yama restricts ptrace, which allows processes to read and modify the
        memory of other processes. This has obvious security implications.

        `none` - Keep the default configuration of your kernel.
        `relaxed` - Only allow parent processes to ptrace child processes.
        `restricted` - No processes may be traced with ptrace.
